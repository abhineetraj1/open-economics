<img src="https://github.com/abhineetraj1/open-economics/raw/main/oil.png" height="300px">
The project is made by Abhineet Raj. It aims to predict the optimal time for a country to buy oil from OPEC in order to obtain more oil at a cheaper rate and prevent economic recession. The prediction is done using logistic regression, a statistical method that can be used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
